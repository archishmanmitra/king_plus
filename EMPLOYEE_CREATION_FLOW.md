# Employee Creation Flow Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a complete employee creation flow with token-based authentication. The flow allows HR/Admin users to create employees, generate invitation tokens, and have new employees complete their registration.

## Flow Description

### 1. Employee Creation (Admin/HR)
- Admin/HR fills out basic employee details (first name, last name, email, role)
- System creates an employee record with `pending` status
- A unique invitation token is generated with 24-hour expiration
- Invitation link is provided to send to the new employee

### 2. Employee Registration (New Employee)
- Employee clicks on the invitation link
- They are redirected to a registration form
- Email and role are pre-filled and cannot be changed
- Employee sets their password
- Upon successful registration, they are redirected to login

### 3. Login (All Users)
- Users can login with their email and password
- JWT tokens are used for authentication
- Token verification happens on each request

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Prisma Schema Updates
- Added `pending` status to `EmployeeStatus` enum
- Existing `UserInvitation` model supports the flow

#### 2. New API Endpoints

**Authentication (`/api/auth`)**
- `POST /login` - User login with email/password
- `GET /verify` - Verify JWT token

**Invitations (`/api/invitations`)**
- `GET /:token` - Get invitation details by token
- `POST /accept` - Accept invitation and create user account

**Employees (`/api/employees`)**
- `POST /` - Create new employee with invitation

#### 3. Security Features
- JWT token-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Token expiration (24 hours for invitations)
- CORS configuration for frontend

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Updated AuthContext
- Real API authentication instead of demo users
- Token storage and verification
- Automatic token refresh on app load

#### 2. Employee Creation Modal
- Form validation for required fields
- API integration for employee creation
- Invitation link generation and sharing

#### 3. Invitation Page
- Token validation and display
- Password setting form
- Automatic redirect to login after completion

#### 4. Test Page
- Complete flow testing interface
- Step-by-step verification
- Available at `/test` route

## Usage Instructions

### For Development
1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Access the test page at `http://localhost:5173/test`

### For Production
1. Set up environment variables in `server/.env`:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
   JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
   PORT=3000
   CORS_ORIGINS="your-frontend-url"
   ```

2. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login with email/password
- `GET /api/auth/verify` - Verify JWT token

### Invitations
- `GET /api/invitations/:token` - Get invitation details
- `POST /api/invitations/accept` - Accept invitation

### Employees
- `POST /api/employees` - Create new employee

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Security**: All passwords are hashed using bcrypt
2. **Token Security**: JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
3. **CORS Protection**: Configured for specific origins
4. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated on both frontend and backend
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

## Testing

The implementation includes a comprehensive test page at `/test` that allows you to:
1. Create test employees
2. Test invitation flow
3. Test login functionality
4. Verify complete end-to-end flow

## Database Schema

The implementation uses the existing Prisma schema with the following key models:
- `User` - User accounts with authentication
- `Employee` - Employee records with official information
- `UserInvitation` - Invitation tokens and status
- `EmployeeOfficial` - Official employee information
- `EmployeePersonal` - Personal employee information (filled during invitation)

## Error Handling

The system handles various error scenarios:
- Invalid or expired invitation tokens
- Duplicate email addresses
- Missing required fields
- Network connectivity issues
- Authentication failures

All errors are properly logged and return user-friendly error messages.
